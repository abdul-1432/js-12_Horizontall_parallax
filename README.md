Horizontal parallax using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for project presentation
Certainly! Here's an example of a README file for a GitHub repository that contains a horizontal parallax effect:

# Horizontal Parallax

This repository provides a simple implementation of a horizontal parallax effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The parallax effect adds depth and interactivity to your website by creating an illusion of depth as the user scrolls horizontally.

## Features

- Easy integration into your web projects.
- Smooth and responsive horizontal scrolling.
- Adjustable parallax speed for different layers.
- Customizable content and styling.
- Lightweight and optimized for performance.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use the horizontal parallax effect in your project, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository as a ZIP file or clone it using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdul-1432/horizontal-parallax.git
   ```

2. Copy the necessary files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to your project directory.

### Usage

To add the horizontal parallax effect to your website, follow these steps:

1. Include the required CSS and JavaScript files in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

   ```HTML
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/horizontal-parallax.css">
   <script src="path/to/horizontal-parallax.js"></script>
   ```

2. Create the HTML structure for the parallax sections:

   ```HTML
   <div class="parallax-container">
     <div class="parallax-section" data-speed="0.5">
       <!-- Content for first parallax section -->
     </div>
     <div class="parallax-section" data-speed="1">
       <!-- Content for second parallax section -->
     </div>
     <!-- Add more parallax sections as needed -->
   </div>
   ```

3. Adjust the `data-speed` attribute for each parallax section to control the scrolling speed. A value of `1` represents normal speed, while values greater than `1` make the section scroll faster and values less than `1` make it scroll slower.

4. Initialize the horizontal parallax effect by calling the `initHorizontalParallax()` function:

   ```javascript
   <script>
     document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
       initHorizontalParallax();
     });
   </script>
   ```
